            <p class="b">
                The Punjab Kings (PBKS), established in 2008 and formerly known as Kings XI Punjab, are a franchise cricket team based in Mohali, Punjab, competing in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Owned by KPH Dream Cricket Private Limited, the team plays its home matches at the PCA New Stadium in Mullanpur. As of the 2025 season, PBKS is captained by Shreyas Iyer and coached by Ricky Ponting. The squad features a mix of experienced players and emerging talents, including Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, and Marco Jansen. Despite being one of the original eight IPL teams, PBKS has yet to secure a championship title, with their best performance being runners-up in 2014. The team aims to break this streak and clinch their maiden title in the upcoming season.
